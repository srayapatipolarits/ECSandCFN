                                                    <p>Please review the following User agreement carefully, as it forms the basis of a legally binding contract between you and Sure People, LLC (&ldquo;SurePeople,&rdquo; &ldquo;we,&rdquo; or &ldquo;us&rdquo;) regarding your access to and use of this website (the &ldquo;Site&rdquo;). By accessing the Site, you agree to be bound by all of the terms and conditions set forth herein.</p>
                                                    <p>SurePeople permits individuals to complete personal assessment questionnaires and other tools, either for their own use or to be used by one of our client companies, who may be employers or consultants (each a &ldquo;Client&rdquo;) and offers the individuals, and/or the Clients access to certain tools and services accessible through the Site, including, but not limited to, personal assessment testing and surveys (the &ldquo;Service&rdquo;).
                                                    </p>
                                                    <p>If you are using the Site on behalf of a Client, you represent and warrant that you are authorized to act on behalf of the Client.</p>
                                                    <p>If you have been referred by the Client to take an assessment on the Site, you are utilizing the Service at the request of and for the benefit of a Client, then current employees of the Client and potential employment candidates of the Client may take and provide answers to one or more assessments through the Service, as requested by the Client. After completion of the assessments or other survey, tools or processes, SurePeople will prepare a profile, report and/or other material based on your responses and potentially those of others solicited through the process with your knowledge and involvement (each an &ldquo;Assessment&rdquo;). SurePeople is not responsible for any Assessment so produced, nor is SurePeople responsible for any hiring or termination decision made by the Client (or any other party) directly or indirectly as a result of the Assessment. By accessing the Site, you agree not to bring, file, or participate in any claim, suit, or complaint against SurePeople as a result of any hiring or termination decision made by the Client or by any other person.</p>
                                                    <p>The Site/Service may not be used unless you are 18 years of age or older. Additional age restrictions may be imposed by us or Clients with respect to use of the Service.</p>
                                                    <p>SurePeople reserves the right to change these User agreement and/or the Service from time to time at its sole discretion by posting such revised terms and conditions on the Site. Your continued use of the Site following any such change constitutes your acknowledgement of such change and your agreement to follow and be bound by the modified terms and conditions, if any.</p>

                          and other Tools</h3>
                                                    <p>Upon accessing the Site and to log in to the Service, all users are asked to submit required and/or optional information on the Registration page. If you are utilizing the Service for your own personal use, you will need to provide a valid credit card for payment for the Service. If you are utilizing the Service at the request of a Client, you will need to provide identification codes provided by the Client. Once logged in to the Service, you will take and provide answers to one or more assessments, surveys or other tools available through the Site. After you complete the assessment(s), SurePeople will prepare one or more profiles based on your responses and/or answers. To the extent you are engaging in a 360 review or other analysis, information will be solicited from others. You are providing these answers/responses to SurePeople to prepare an analysis and/or report. If you are utilizing the Site at a Client&rsquo;s request, you agree that SurePeople will provide your Assessment, SurePeople profile and all data to the Client. Your answers may also be used later by SurePeople to prepare different Assessments for other Clients (ones different than the Client to whom you are currently applying and in connection with which you originally supplied your answers and responses to SurePeople). SurePeople will not supply your answers to Clients unless expressly requested by Clients. If you do not want your responses or answers used or re-used in this manner and/or an Assessment shared with any Client(s), you must not accept these terms; though doing so will preclude you from using the Service or the Site. For additional information on how such information, answers, and/or responses will be used, please see the SurePeople Privacy Policy.</p>
                                                    <p>If you are providing a credit card (&ldquo;Card&rdquo;) for utilization of the Service, you represent and warrant to us and the Card issuer that you are the owner of or otherwise authorized to utilize the Card to access the Service, and agree that the terms and privacy policy of the Card issuer shall also apply to your use of the Service in connection with the Card. In addition, to the Card issuer&rsquo;s terms and privacy policy, if we believe you are misusing the Services we may (on our own or in conjunction with the Card issuer) suspend your ability to utilize the Service.</p>
                                                    <p>Each user agrees to provide accurate and complete responses. SurePeople uses technology that analyzes answers and responses to determine the accuracy and consistency of responses. Should SurePeople, in its sole discretion, believe that any response or information provided is untrue, inaccurate, incomplete, not provided in good faith or not current, SurePeople has the right to suspend or terminate any user&rsquo;s use of the Service and/or access to the Site. In the event you are using the Service at the request of the Client, you authorize SurePeople to advise the Client that SurePeople has invalidated test results as part of the Assessment. You grant SurePeople a non-exclusive, perpetual, royalty-free license to use the responses and/or answers provided by you in any manner and through any medium in the sole discretion of SurePeople (although SurePeople will not disclose any personally identifiable information to any person except the Client or designated third parties at your request or at the request of the Client). This grant includes the right of SurePeople to re-use your answers and responses to complete a different Assessment for a different Client than the Client to whom you applied and in connection with which you originally supplied your answers and responses to SurePeople. You agree that SurePeople shall have no obligation to provide you with a copy of the test(s) taken through the Service, a copy of your answers or responses, a copy of any Assessment or other material provided to the Client, or a list of other Clients for which SurePeople provided an Assessment based on your original answers and responses. SurePeople, its Assessments and the Service are not intended to screen persons on the basis of any legally protected status, such as race, color, religion, sex, national origin, sexual orientation, age or disability.</p>
                                                    <p>Each test may be taken only once. You are not authorized to take any test more than once unless the Client has specifically requested that you do so or permitted by SurePeople in its sole discretion. Title, ownership rights, and all intellectual property rights in and to the Site and the Service, including, without limitation, patents, copyrights, trademarks and trade secrets, shall remain with SurePeople and/or its licensors. The tests provided through the Service, and the form and content of all Assessments and other material provided by SurePeople through the Site are proprietary to SurePeople and are protected by the copyright laws of the United States and international copyright treaties.</p>
                                                    <p>As noted above, the Client may direct us to disclose your personally identifiable information to third parties for purposes related to the Services, including, but not limited to, employment screening, background checks, references, 360 assessments and/or credential verification services, including verification of the accuracy of your personal information and confirmation of your references. You agree that neither SurePeople nor Clients are responsible or liable for the use and dissemination of such information by such third parties. If you do not want your personally identifiable information shared with any third parties, do not accept these terms (i.e., do not click the &ldquo;I Agree&rdquo; button), though doing so will preclude you from using the Service or the Site.</p>
                                                    <p>SurePeople will retain the personally identifiable information, responses, and answers you provide for fulfillment of the intended purposes for which it is collected. We will establish minimum and maximum retention periods based upon the type of information collected (i.e. sensitivity), the intended purposes, and as otherwise may be legally required.</p>

                          Services</h3>
                                                    <p>Certain of the SurePeople services are only available if a membership subscription is purchased (the &ldquo;SurePeople Services&rdquo;): By agreeing to subscribe to any SurePeople Services you agree to accept and pay the specified fees set forth for the particular SurePeople Service to which you subscribe. Subject to any applicable law, fees for SurePeople Services are non-refundable. You will be notified of any applicable fees before you start incurring liability for such fees and, by providing your billing information, you agree that you are liable for payment of such fees. SurePeople reserves the right to change its fees or billing methods at any time and will provide thirty days notice of any such changes in the same manner as described herein for changes in these Terms.</p>
                                                    <p>You must provide a valid method of payment (e.g. credit card) prior to and during any times you receive billable SurePeople Services. You expressly authorize SurePeople (or third parties acting on its behalf) to charge all fees, to the payment method you have designated. You will be liable for any fees (including reasonable attorney&rsquo;s fees) SurePeople incurs in its efforts to collect any unpaid balances. You must bring any billing problems or discrepancies to SurePeople&rsquo;s attention within 90 days from the date you are billed. If you do not bring them to SurePeople&rsquo;s attention within 90 days, you agree that you waive your right to dispute such problems or discrepancies with SurePeople. SurePeople may suspend or terminate your use of the SurePeople Services if you fail to provide a valid designated payment method upon request or if SurePeople is unable for any reason to bill charges to your designated payment method.</p>
                                                    <p>You are responsible for all fees and charges incurred by you or anyone you allow to use your account. This means that, unless your account or payment method information is obtained unlawfully or fraudulently by someone other than those authorized to use your account, you will be responsible for all usage and purchases under your account.</p>
                                                    <p>Employer/Clients may pay for fees on a per employee basis. Fees paid for each individual employee or groups of employees are not transferable among employees. If an employer/client deletes or terminates an employee from an account, the employee cannot be replaced in SurePeople&rsquo;s records.</p>
                                                    <p>Fees for SurePeople Services automatically renew at the then current fee. If you do not terminate within 30 days of the automatic renewal or as otherwise permitted under applicable law, you will be responsible for the full cost of the renewed subscription.</p>
