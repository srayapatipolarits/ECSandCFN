SurePeople may use de-identified information including Assessment Information for analytical and statistical purposes, as well as to present anonymous profiles of candidates to prospective employers who we believe are looking for particular capabilities.

                                                    <p>In the event we are engaged in or contemplating a merger or other corporate acquisition with another business entity, personal information may be disclosed to and would likely be acquired by the other business entity.
