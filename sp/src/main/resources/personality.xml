			<Detail Type="MobilityPreference">&lt;p&gt;[Name] is able to remain still for long period of time, pondering the issues at hand.&lt;/p&gt;</Detail>
			<Detail Type="EnvironmentalStressors">&lt;p&gt;Making changes without [Name] understanding ‘why’ or failing to include [him/her] in the decision-making process will cause stress, as will pressuring [him/her] to act without providing adequate preparation time.&lt;/p&gt;</Detail>
			<Detail Type="OverUses">&lt;p&gt;[Name] can be bound up with procedures and ‘fail-safe’ controls, exhibiting a “this is how it's supposed to be done" attitude. [He/She] may be reluctant to change, exhibiting an over-dependence on people and processes that have been previously engaged.&lt;/p&gt;</Detail>
			<Detail Type="WhenPressured">&lt;p&gt;[Name] has a tendency to internalize conflict and dwell on past conflicts. [HE/SHE] can be [his/her] own worst enemy.&lt;/p&gt;</Detail>

			<Detail Type="SummaryOfStrengths">&lt;p&gt;Analytical, detailed, organized, cautious and accurate.&lt;/p&gt;</Detail>
			<Detail Type="JobMatch">&lt;p&gt;Because ACTUARIES desire to be logical, accurate, practical and thorough, [Name] may function most effectively when [his/her] work environment is structured and organized. In the job description, [he/she] may prefer the opportunity to:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;*Analyze 		*Be accurate 		*Review details	*Critique &amp; improve&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;*Follow procedures 	*Follow up on details	*Ensure Quality		*Organize 	  *Perform identified tasks *Plan with committees 	*Research concepts 	*Work with objects&lt;/p&gt;</Detail>
			<Detail Type="ToCommunicateWithAsLeader">&lt;p&gt;Since ACTUARIES are naturally logical, organized and accurate, [Name] may tend to resist change or be rigid unless [he/she] understands the reasons for change. Provide [him/her] with well-researched details, facts and data to explain the reasons. [He/She] is likely to be motivated by logic, not by strong emotions.&lt;/p&gt;</Detail>
			<Detail Type="ToDisagreeWithAsLeader">&lt;p&gt;Carefully document your position with facts and data that have been well researched, offering [Name] proof before asking [him/her] to consider the case. Do not push [him/her] too hard, and give [him/her] time to consider the evidence and apply logic. [He/She] needs time to process information. Do not put [him/her] ‘on the spot’ by publicly embarrassing or correcting [him/her]. With [his/her] extremely high standards, [he/she] is prone to be [his/her] own worst enemy.&lt;/p&gt;</Detail>
			<Detail Type="PossibleNegativePerceptionsOfOthers">&lt;p&gt;[Name] may see others with strong personalities as “know-it-all’s” who initiate plans without considering important details and procedures. In such instances, there may be a tendency to become territorial over who is correct and most accurate. [He/She] may demonstrate impatience at times, viewing others as inaccurate, disorganized, embellishing or boastful. [He/She] may also be concerned with others not having the details to make good decisions.&lt;/p&gt;</Detail>
			<Detail Type="NegativePerceptionsOthersMayHave">&lt;p&gt;Others may perceive [Name] as being bogged down and overly concerned with petty details, an impediment to progress. [His/Her] attention to detail may come across to some as pessimistic — a ‘wet blanket’ when it comes to accepting new ideas. Because [Name] prefers to be accurate and precise, those with soft personalities may feel judged by [him/her].&lt;/p&gt;</Detail>
			<Detail Type="NotableCharacteristics">&lt;p&gt;ACTUARIES are generally perceived as conscientious, logical, reserved, reflective and careful to avoid unnecessary risks. [Name] may likely be very perceptive of hidden agendas or ulterior motives, and [he/she] has difficulty relaxing until there is certainty of a decision or action being fundamentally sound.&lt;/p&gt;</Detail>
			<Detail Type="FundamentalDesiresDrive">&lt;p&gt;[Name] possesses a bent towards accuracy, as well as being factual, careful and cooperative, [he/she] strives to do things the right way. Others may perceive [him/her] as being a perfectionist or indecisive. &lt;/p&gt;</Detail>
			<Detail Type="RecommendedImprovements">&lt;p&gt;[Name] may expend too much energy and time getting bogged down in the details. Fretting and worrying over small matters can create a habit of checking and re-checking, which can irritate others. [He/She] can be overly analytical and even a barrier to progress. If [he/she] learns to act quicker, it would benefit work associates. [His/Her] high standards and critical nature may present problems. Focusing on being more practical and compromising for a good, rather than perfect, solution would be helpful. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;[Name] may be overly sensitive at times, taking things too personally in the workplace.

			<Detail Type="JobMatch">&lt;p&gt;[Name] may function most effectively when given an opportunity to influence or meet or entertain people. [He/She] will need variety and opportunities to express new and creative ideas with a minimum of focused or detailed work. Because [he/she] may work at a steady pace, [he/she] may demonstrate an excellent ability to follow through on assignments.

In the job description, [he/she] may be inclined to prefer opportunities to do the following:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;*Be active 		*Be humorous 			*Be loyal 	 *Be relational&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;*Communicate		*Entertain 			*Follow the leader *Gain recognition&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;*Influence 		*Master familiar material 	*Network 	 *Perform&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;*Set an example 	*Support Others 		*Verbalize&lt;/p&gt;</Detail>
			<Detail Type="ToCommunicateWithAsLeader">&lt;p&gt;[Name] may be open to personal testimony and endorsement usually because [he/she] is motivated to relate to others, especially to those who are prestigious. Persuade [him/her] by conveying ‘who’ is involved and ‘who’ thinks it is a good idea. Also, show how the project will be fun and exciting. Give the ‘big picture,’ but remind [him/her] often of the details or [he/she] may forget them. Because [he/she] is inclined to be practical, [he/she] will want to know the specifics of how things will be done and how it will affect others. Prepare [him/her] in advance for change.&lt;/p&gt;</Detail>
			<Detail Type="ToDisagreeWithAsLeader">&lt;p&gt;If you postpone an immediate decision, [Name] may lose an emotional attachment to the idea. Delaying the decision for a day or two may open the door for [him/her] to accept other new ideas. You may want to provide a specific example of how an idea, concept or plan has worked in other settings. Take a team approach and reassure [him/her] of your relationship. Disagreement with [him/her] may be interpreted as a personal rejection. Assurances of being ‘in this together’ enable [him/her] to relax and accommodate something new and different.&lt;/p&gt;</Detail>
			<Detail Type="PossibleNegativePerceptionsOfOthers">&lt;p&gt;[Name] may quietly build resentment toward others who have a ‘bulldozer’ type of personality. [He/She] may view others as trying to bog down the process with trivial and excessive caution or details. [He/She] may feel judged by others or may take it personally when someone else is in conflict with [him/her].&lt;/p&gt;</Detail>

Some may find [him/her] disorganized, inaccurate and likely to exaggerate. Some may be jealous of how much attention [he/she] is inclined to receive from work associates and those within [his/her] social circle. Those with strong personalities may see [him/her] as passive, unassertive, undisciplined and less productive because of [his/her] tendency to make relationships a higher priority than completing the task.&lt;/p&gt;</Detail>
			<Detail Type="NotableCharacteristics">&lt;p&gt;Others are likely to see [Name] as easy-going, friendly, relaxed and independent. [He/She] is a ‘nice person’ who is non-threatening; as a result, others may find it difficult to dislike [him/her]. People may come to [him/her] with their problems because [he/she] is likable and a good listener. If [Name] has any suggestions, they are likely to be offered in indirect, offhanded ways. Abruptness is rare. People are drawn to [him/her] because of [his/her] warmth, sympathy, empathy and understanding. [Name]'s self-confidence modesty, poise, mildness, persistence and loyalty make [him/her] a likable person. [He/She] has a deep desire for acceptance among peers and probably has many friends.&lt;/p&gt;</Detail>
			<Detail Type="FundamentalDesiresDrive">&lt;p&gt;[Name] is usually patient, personable, unassuming and steadfast. [He/She] probably wants to work with and help people in a personal and unhurried environment. Regardless of [his/her] occupation, [he/she] will generally tend to advise others in a good-natured and pleasant way.&lt;/p&gt;</Detail>
			<Detail Type="RecommendedImprovements">&lt;p&gt;[Name] dislikes having to give direct orders and may be too lenient with marginal workers.

There is also a possibility of holding grudges against those who are critical. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;[Name] may be inclined to struggle with disorganization, overlooking key details and becoming easily distracted. It would be benefit [him/her] to take the necessary time to plan, write down details and stay focused. [He/She] is generally a good starter but poor finisher. [He/She] may also be too optimistic and may need to concentrate on being more realistic. [He/She] would learn more by listening more and talking less. [He/She] is prone to compromise too much in an attempt to keep the peace. It would be helpful for [him/her] to be more assertive, learning to say ‘no’ and addressing conflict instead of shying away from it. [He/She] should hold others accountable for their actions when it is appropriate. [He/She] may be involved in ‘silent lying,’ or failing to speak when doing so would reveal valuable information that could prompt change.

				<p>With an uncompromising drive for results, [Name] may be perceived as direct, blunt, forceful or uncaring in some situations. This striving for results is definitely [his/her] strength, but when carried too far, it may create difficulty for others who are not as driven.</p>

			<Detail Type="WorkEnvironmentContribution">&lt;p&gt;[Name] easily grasps the ‘big picture’ and utilizes verbal skills and high energy to mobilize people and achieve results.

			<Detail Type="RelationalTaskOrientation">&lt;p&gt;[Name] relates well to people but under pressure prioritizes tasks. [He/She] is unusually motivated by succeeding in situations where others were not even willing to try.&lt;/p&gt;</Detail>
			<Detail Type="MobilityPreference">&lt;p&gt;Needs mobility; desires engaging in multiple projects; seeks a constant flurry of activity, variety and change.&lt;/p&gt;</Detail>
			<Detail Type="EnvironmentalStressors">&lt;p&gt;The confinement of routines, processing detailed information and a lack of access to people creates stress for [Name]. [He/She] possibly has a tendency to over-commit, causing stress to others, as well as to [him/her]self.&lt;/p&gt;</Detail>
			<Detail Type="OverUses">&lt;p&gt;A win-lose competitive style; may be inclined to become impatient when the pace of a project seems to move too slowly.&lt;/p&gt;</Detail>
			<Detail Type="WhenPressured">&lt;p&gt;[He/She] may overstep boundaries and ‘bulldoze’ others, resisting being a team player while becoming overly critical of others.&lt;/p&gt;</Detail>
			<Detail Type="UneasyWhen">&lt;p&gt;It is necessary to be ‘soft’ on others, when [he/she] believes that others are taking advantage of [him/her], or when the work pace seems to be moving too slowly.&lt;/p&gt;</Detail>

			<Detail Type="SummaryOfStrengths">&lt;p&gt;Direct, independent, ambitious, result-oriented, confident, and adept at solving problems. [Name] is likely to demonstrate a willingness to tackle difficult or undefined projects.&lt;/p&gt;</Detail>
			<Detail Type="JobMatch">&lt;p&gt;Because [Name] may be a take-charge person, [he/she] is likely to function most effectively when presented with challenges or obstacles with a minimum of problem-solving details. Because of [his/her] influential nature, [he/she] may function best when given the opportunity to meet people. [He/She] will need a variety of opportunities to express new or creative ideas and a minimum of detailed work that requires a sustained focus. In the job description, [Name] may prefer the opportunity to:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;*Be active 		*Be humorous 		*Be in charge 		*Verbalize  *Communicate 		*Create 		*Decide 		*Develop 	&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;*Direct 			*Entertain 		*Gain recognition 	*Influence 	&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;*Initiate solutions 	*Lead others 		*Manage 		*Network &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;*Perform 		*Solve problems 	*Supervise 		*Be in control&lt;/p&gt;</Detail>
			<Detail Type="ToCommunicateWithAsLeader">&lt;p&gt;Since [Name] is a bottom-line person, discuss the end result with [him/her] first. You are likely to lose [his/her] attention if you become bogged-down with the details. Give the ‘big picture’ or summarize first and then provide explanations, details and concerns, if requested. Since [he/she] is not by nature a good listener, it may be helpful to compose your thoughts into a short memo, presenting the problems, options and recommended actions. [He/She] is likely to be open to personal testimony and endorsement, usually because [he/she] is motivated by relating to others, especially those who are prestigious. Persuade [him/her] by conveying ‘who’ is involved and ‘who’ thinks it is a good idea.&lt;/p&gt;</Detail>
			<Detail Type="ToDisagreeWithAsLeader">&lt;p&gt;Find the larger goal or the ‘big picture’ you can agree upon first, then propose the plan that will expedite reaching it. [Name] can be highly committed to reaching a goal, with the particular methodology a lesser priority. If you postpone an immediate decision, [he/she] may eventually lose the emotional attachment to an idea. Delaying the decision for a day or two may open the door for [him/her] to accept other ideas.&lt;/p&gt;</Detail>
			<Detail Type="PossibleNegativePerceptionsOfOthers">&lt;p&gt;[Name] is prone to see others with a similar personality as territorial. Conflict may ensue over control. [He/She] is apt to be turned off by too much talk and not enough results and may see others as less motivated or bogging down the process with trivial and excessive caution to details. [He/She] may quite possibly be jealous of someone else receiving more attention and may see others as being too sensitive, pessimistic or slow in their work. &lt;/p&gt;</Detail>
			<Detail Type="NegativePerceptionsOthersMayHave">&lt;p&gt;Others may see [Name] as disinterested or ‘on a mission.’ Those with soft personalities may see [him/her] as insensitive, self-centered and bullish. Detail-oriented people may perceive [Name] as having a ‘know-it-all’ attitude and one who ‘throws caution to the wind.’ Others might find [him/her] to be disorganized, inaccurate or one who exaggerates facts.&lt;/p&gt;</Detail>
			<Detail Type="NotableCharacteristics">&lt;p&gt;[Name] can be aggressive, persuasive and action-oriented. [He/She] will go for desired results regardless of the obstacles. Quitting or ‘giving in’ is unlikely and [he/she] tends to thrive on challenging endeavors. When the environment seems favorable, [he/she] can be very friendly, but if the environment is antagonistic, [he/she] can get very ‘tough minded.’&lt;/p&gt;</Detail>
			<Detail Type="FundamentalDesiresDrive">&lt;p&gt;[Name] often is confident and will charge ahead despite obstacles. [He/She] may view resistance and opposition as a challenge and is most effective where innovation and results are important. [He/She] is likely to have the stamina to sustain a fast pace and will expect others to keep up. Decisions are made quickly and easily with the recognition that some restraints or limitations are necessary. However, [he/she] will not let unnecessary restraints stop [him/her] from pressing toward the goal. Assuming there is a healthy level of confidence, [Name] often adopts the slogan ‘Just Do It’ as a personal motto. &lt;/p&gt;</Detail>
			<Detail Type="RecommendedImprovements">&lt;p&gt;With [Name] being carefully aggressive, tensely tactful, self-critical and overly serious, [he/she] tends to drive for results with ‘one foot on the gas pedal and the other on the brake.’ There is a tension between the ‘big picture’ and getting the details together that may leave [him/her] struggling with indecision. Never appearing to be fully satisfied with anything, others may see [Name] as vacillating. The impact [he/she] has on others is stronger than [he/she] may realize. Possessing a strong personality, [he/she] either empowers others or leaves them feeling hurt and criticized. [He/She] can be overbearing, pushy, or insensitive. Consideration of others’ feelings may be a more positive posture to assume when working together on a common project or objective. Having high standards and being rather critical may be a problem. Focusing on being more practical and learning to settle for a ‘good solution’ is more beneficial than striving for the ‘perfect solution.’ It would be helpful for [him/her] to work on cooperating with team members, becoming more tactful and warm, and recognizing [his/her] limitations. [He/She] should also work on receiving feedback graciously. &lt;/p&gt;</Detail>
			<Detail Type="HowToSuperviseAndEncourage">&lt;p&gt;[Name] needs a manager who will tap into [his/her] creative flow and implement better ideas. [He/She] needs a leader who will help get things finished and begin new projects, one who is direct and who will accept [Name]’s directness. A passive or carefree manager is not going to work. [Name] needs challenging assignments that will be stimulating. [He/She] may also need a manager who is strong enough to remind [him/her] to soften up, noting the impact [he/she] has on others.&lt;/p&gt;</Detail>

It is also possible that some may be jealous of how much attention [he/she] is inclined to receive from work associates and those within [his/her] social circle. Those with strong personalities may see [Name] as passive, unassertive, undisciplined or less productive because of [his/her] tendency to make relationships a higher priority than completing a task.&lt;/p&gt;</Detail>

			<Detail Type="JobMatch">&lt;p&gt;With the desire to be logical, [Name] is generally motivated to be accurate, precise and practical. [He/She] tends to prefer work that is organized and structured with clear objectives and will need opportunities to entertain, meet and influence people. [He/She] desires to express creative ideas. In the job description, [he/she] may prefer the opportunity to: &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;*Analyze 		*Be accurate 		*Be active 		*Be humorous&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;*Be thorough 		*Communicate 		*Critique and improve 	*Entertain&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;*Influence 		*Interact		*Network		*Organize&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;*Perform 		*Plan 			*Process 		*Reflect&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;*Relate 			*Research 		*Verbalize&lt;/p&gt;</Detail>
			<Detail Type="ToCommunicateWithAsLeader">&lt;p&gt;Since individuals with this personality are naturally logical, organized and accurate, [Name] may resist change and be inflexible unless [he/she] first understands the reasons for change. Provide [him/her] with the rationale for change, decisions, and actions, using well-researched details, facts and data. Because of a tendency for [him/her] to be relational, persuade [him/her] by conveying ‘who’ is involved and ‘who’ thinks it is a good idea. Clarify how the new idea may be exciting and fun.&lt;/p&gt;</Detail>
			<Detail Type="ToDisagreeWithAsLeader">&lt;p&gt;Carefully document your position to [Name] with facts and data that have been well researched, offering proof. Then ask [him/her] to consider the case. Do not push too hard, but rather, give [him/her] time to consider the evidence and apply logic, as [he/she] may need time to process information. [He/She] can be highly committed to personal ideas but over time, [he/she] can lose an emotional attachment. Delaying the decision for a few days may possibly open the door for [him/her] to consider new ideas.&lt;/p&gt;</Detail>
			<Detail Type="PossibleNegativePerceptionsOfOthers">&lt;p&gt;[Name] may see some work associates with strong personalities as having a ‘know-it-all’ attitude. Also, [he/she] may be concerned that others who do not have the details cannot make good decisions. [He/She] may see others as less motivated, disorganized or inaccurate.&lt;/p&gt;</Detail>
			<Detail Type="NegativePerceptionsOthersMayHave">&lt;p&gt;Some may see [Name] as being overly concerned with the details. [He/She] may appear to be emotional or as ‘blowing in the wind’ in some situations. On other occasions, [he/she] may be perceived as rigid or unbending. Some may feel competitive towards [Name] because of [his/her] influential nature and ability to assemble facts. Some may see [him/her] as fickle because of his logical approach in some instances and [his/her] emotional approach at other times.&lt;/p&gt;</Detail>
			<Detail Type="NotableCharacteristics">&lt;p&gt;[Name] is apt to be enthusiastic, talkative and diplomatic. If there is a need to influence others, [he/she] will likely do so with tact and modesty. [He/She] quite possibly mixes well in social and business situations, making small talk easily and opening conversations with a smooth and low-pressure approach. Having an easy-going demeanor, [he/she] generally maintains a pleasant atmosphere of good will. [He/She] may be able to joke at [his/her] own expense and get mileage out of the teasing that comes from others.&lt;/p&gt;</Detail>
			<Detail Type="FundamentalDesiresDrive">&lt;p&gt;[Name] quite possibly seeks open recognition from others and deeply desires to be liked by associates. [He/She] prefers settings that places a high value on a friendly and familiar environment. [He/She] desires to be outgoing, alert, tactful and unassuming. [He/She] has an internal drive to seek a work environment that will offer prestige.&lt;/p&gt;</Detail>
			<Detail Type="RecommendedImprovements">&lt;p&gt;[Name] is more of a diplomat than a taskmaster in work relationships. Some people may find [him/her] to be superficial because of [his/her] tendency to approach people with a casual and indirect style. [He/She] might want to strive to be more direct and purposeful in relationships. And [he/she] may want to take a second look when estimating the abilities of others and not expect more than what [he/she] is likely to get. [He/She] may be too sensitive at times and should try not to take things too personally in the work environment. [He/She] needs to work on following through, displaying sensitivity when [he/she] disagrees with others, and identifying the proper work pace. [He/She] may need to discover a means to find balance in personal tasks by listening to others' ideas.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;</Detail>
			<Detail Type="HowToSuperviseAndEncourage">&lt;p&gt;[Name] can be helpful in mobilizing people in a non-threatening and low-pressure manner. [He/She] will most certainly prefer a manager who is friendly and pleasant when things are going well, but who is supportive when the work situation is not proceeding as expected. Allow for a free exchange of ideas with [him/her], as [he/she] desires a supervisor who will listen and provide feedback using a cordial tone. Addressing one another should be done on a first-name basis. Allowing for social interactions will go a long way in keeping [his/her] morale positive.&lt;/p&gt;</Detail>

[He/She] likes to ‘move, shake and make it happen’ and has a strong need to accomplish ‘the mission.’</p>
				<p>[Name] is likely to use [his/her] persuasive verbal skills to recruit others for a cause. Even though [he/she] can overwhelm others, [he/she] is apt to be well liked by work associates. [He/She] clearly prefers to ‘work through others’ rather than ‘working on them.’ Hidden within [Name]’s strong personality is a softer and more empathetic approach that is not readily apparent to most.</p>

			<Detail Type="WorkEnvironmentContribution">&lt;p&gt;[Name] easily grasps the ‘big picture’ and utilizes verbal skills, applying high energy to mobilize people and achieve results.

			<Detail Type="SummaryOfStrengths">&lt;p&gt;Independent, result-oriented, confident, problem-solver and direct.&lt;/p&gt;</Detail>
			<Detail Type="JobMatch">&lt;p&gt;Because [Name] may be a take-charge kind of person, [he/she] is likely to be most effective when given independence, challenges, obstacles to overcome, problems to solve and a minimum of details. Because of [his/her] influential nature, [he/she] may also function best when given the opportunity to meet or entertain people. [Name] will need a variety of opportunities to express new and creative ideas and a minimum of focused or detail-oriented work. In a leadership position, [he/she] may prefer the opportunity to:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;*Be active 		*Be humorous 		*Be in charge 		*Be in control&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;*Build 			*Communicate 		*Create 		*Decide&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;*Develop 		*Direct 			*Entertain 		*Gain recognition&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;*Influence 		*Initiate solutions 	*Lead others 		*Manage&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;*Network 		*Perform 		*Relate 			*Solve problems&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;*Supervise 		*Verbalize&lt;/p&gt;</Detail>
			<Detail Type="ToCommunicateWithAsLeader">&lt;p&gt;Since [Name] is a bottom-line person, discuss the end result with [him/her] first. You are inclined to lose [his/her] attention if you become bogged-down by elaborating on the details. Provide [him/her] with the ‘big picture’ or summarize first and then provide explanations, details and concerns. Since [he/she] is not by nature a good listener, it often is helpful to compose your thoughts into a short memo, detailing the problems, options and recommended actions. [Name] will likely be open to personal testimony and endorsement, usually because [he/she] is motivated by relating to others (especially those who are prestigious). Persuade [him/her] by conveying who is involved and who thinks it is a good idea. Also show how the project will be fun and exciting. Remind [him/her] often of the details or [he/she] may forget them.&lt;/p&gt;</Detail>
			<Detail Type="ToDisagreeWithAsLeader">&lt;p&gt;Find the larger goal or the ‘big picture’ you can agree upon first, then propose the plan that will expedite reaching the goal. [Name] can be highly committed toward reaching goals, but the particular methodology used is secondary for [him/her]. If you postpone an immediate decision, [he/she] is prone to lose emotional attachment to the idea. Delaying the decision for a day or two may open the door for [him/her] to accept alternate ideas.&lt;/p&gt;</Detail>
			<Detail Type="PossibleNegativePerceptionsOfOthers">&lt;p&gt;[Name] is prone to see others with a similar personality as territorial. Conflict may ensue over control. [He/She] is apt to be turned off by too much talk and not enough results. [He/She] may see some others as less motivated or as attempting to bog down the process with trivial and excessive caution or details. [He/She] may quite possibly be jealous of others who receive more attention. [He/She] may also see others as being too sensitive, pessimistic or slow when working.&lt;/p&gt;</Detail>
			<Detail Type="NegativePerceptionsOthersMayHave">&lt;p&gt;Others may see [Name] as disinterested or ‘on a mission.’ Those with soft personalities may see [him/her] as insensitive, self-centered or bullish. Detailed people may perceive [him/her] as having a "know-it-all" attitude and one who ‘throws caution to the wind.’ Others might feel [he/she] is disorganized, inaccurate and one who exaggerates the facts.&lt;/p&gt;</Detail>
			<Detail Type="NotableCharacteristics">&lt;p&gt;[Name] quite conceivably has an entrepreneurial attitude and is assertive, persuasive, independent and adventurous. [He/She] typically has a stubborn determination and is not afraid to try something new, desiring to move ahead even without the advice or backing of others. Boredom is [Name]'s enemy, as [he/she] drives toward bigger and better things. Being flexible and self-motivated, [he/she] usually exhibits a high tolerance for pressure.&lt;/p&gt;</Detail>
			<Detail Type="FundamentalDesiresDrive">&lt;p&gt;[Name] is prone to be hard driving and confident, with an ability to charge ahead despite the obstacles. [He/She] views resistance and opposition as a challenge and is most effective when innovation and results are important.&lt;/p&gt;</Detail>
			<Detail Type="RecommendedImprovements">&lt;p&gt;[Name] may find corporate structure and controls to be annoying and unnecessary. Being a maverick type, [he/she] may push boundaries and change jobs several times in an effort to find the right niche. These moves may not always be voluntary. [He/She] is likely to be a self-starter but may leave the completion of a task to someone else. Learning to stay with a task until its end would allow [him/her] to be a more effective worker. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;[Name] may be inclined to act before thinking. [He/She] can see the ‘big picture’ but may not fully understand the amount of detailed work that is required. Seeking feedback from co-workers and friends who are more detail-oriented would help [him/her] gain a better understanding of the steps involved in a particular process. [He/She] is prone to struggle with disorganization, overlooking key facts while becoming easily distracted. It would benefit [him/her] to take the necessary time to plan, write down details and stay focused, as [he/she] is generally a good starter but a poor finisher. [He/She] would be more effective with a stronger commitment to help others succeed in their objectives and by being more sensitive and a better listener.&lt;/p&gt;</Detail>
			<Detail Type="HowToSuperviseAndEncourage">&lt;p&gt;Being ambitious and desiring of moving ahead quickly, [Name] may not be easy to manage. Give [him/her] as much freedom as possible to run things the way [he/she] deems appropriate. [He/She] may need to be reminded that limitations to authority exist. [He/She] works best with a friendly supervisor with whom open discussion and ‘telling it like it is’ will be expected and accepted.&lt;/p&gt;</Detail>

			<Detail Type="ToDisagreeWithAsLeader">&lt;p&gt;If you postpone an immediate decision, [Name] may eventually lose the emotional attachment to an idea.

Abruptness is rare. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;People are naturally drawn to [Name] because of [his/her] warmth, sympathy, empathy and understanding.

				<p>Individuals with a RESEARCHER personality profile exhibit opposing strengths. As a RESEARCHER, [Name] has a complex personality. [He/She] is typically objective and analytical and will calmly and steadily pursue a path towards a fixed goal. [He/She] is likely to be successful in many ways due to a driving determination and a persistence to follow through on most projects. [He/She] tends to seek out goals and purposes with which [he/she] can develop an organized plan accompanied by definitive action steps.</p>
				<p>[Name] desires tangible results and attaining a high</p>
			</Narrative1>
			<Narrative2>
				<p>level of excellence. [He/She] tenaciously strives to achieve defined agendas and objectives. Others may have to be confrontational to change [his/her] direction. As a result, [he/she] could be perceived as opinionated or stubborn. [He/She] tends to respond with logic more than with emotions and performs well with challenges that require the application of factual data and analysis to form a conclusion. Preferring to work alone, [he/she] may not be especially interested in ‘pleasing’ people. Adherence to [his/her] personal standards can occasionally take precedence over relationships. Decision-</p>
			</Narrative2>
			<Narrative3>
				<p>making can be restrained by the desire to explore all possible options before arriving at a conclusive decision. [His/Her] strength of personality and desire to ‘get it right’ may be perceived by others as being inflexible or ‘bending like a steel post!’</p>
				<p>When in ‘task mode,’ some work relationships may not receive the important attention and energy necessary. There is a tendency to evaluate people and ideas on the basis of facts and logic. Consequently, [Name]’s effectiveness in dealing with others can be developed by seeking to understand their perspectives and feelings.</p>
			</Narrative3>
			<Detail Type="WorkEnvironmentContribution">&lt;p&gt;[Name] is usually accurate and efficient with the details and is not easily distracted. [He/She] will likely work on the task, determined to follow through by working with others or alone. &lt;/p&gt;</Detail>
			<Detail Type="EmotionalPosture">&lt;p&gt;Typically self-disciplined, determined and dispassionate.&lt;/p&gt;</Detail>
			<Detail Type="DrivingIdeal">&lt;p&gt;High standards, determination and ‘getting it right!’&lt;/p&gt;</Detail>
			<Detail Type="AssessesOthersBy">&lt;p&gt;The use of information and data that is factual and accurate. &lt;/p&gt;</Detail>
			<Detail Type="MotivationalStyle">&lt;p&gt;Tenacity, determination and the ability to follow through.&lt;/p&gt;</Detail>
			<Detail Type="MostFavorableWorkEnvironment">&lt;p&gt;[Name] most likely prefers working alone on projects without being bothered by small talk or interruptions. [He/She] prefers written communications rather than conversation.&lt;/p&gt;</Detail>
			<Detail Type="RelationalTaskOrientation">&lt;p&gt;It is likely that [Name] has tendencies to be very task-driven and result-oriented. [He/She] is likely to be detailed and specific rather than global in orientation. Where some see the ‘forest,’ [he/she] sees the specific ‘trees in the forest.’ [His/Her] interactions with others can be brief and direct.&lt;/p&gt;</Detail>
			<Detail Type="MobilityPreference">&lt;p&gt;[Name] is apt to be very good at working on one project for long periods of time.&lt;/p&gt;</Detail>
			<Detail Type="EnvironmentalStressors">&lt;p&gt;[Name] tends to be objective and task-oriented. Inconvenient interruptions, office politics and ‘talkers’ usually cause [him/her] stress. Even though [he/she] prefers to avoid the ‘spotlight,’ [he/she] becomes stressed when appreciation is not occasionally expressed or credit given for a job well done. [He/She] may be especially aware of work associates who fail to pull their fair share of the load.&lt;/p&gt;</Detail>
			<Detail Type="OverUses">&lt;p&gt;Bluntness, directness and suspicion of others.&lt;/p&gt;</Detail>
			<Detail Type="WhenPressured">&lt;p&gt;[Name] may tend to internalize conflict, remembering previous slights.&lt;/p&gt;</Detail>
			<Detail Type="UneasyWhen">&lt;p&gt;Having to deal with large groups of people or having to promote or sell abstract ideas.&lt;/p&gt;</Detail>
			<Detail Type="Leadership">&lt;p&gt;[Name] is prone to lead by being productive, keeping the activity moving in a timely fashion, and by being direct with those who are falling behind.&lt;/p&gt;</Detail>
			<Detail Type="SummaryOfStrengths">&lt;p&gt;Accurate, tenacious, self-starting, capable of excellence, thrives on challenge.&lt;/p&gt;</Detail>
			<Detail Type="JobMatch">&lt;p&gt;With a desire to be logical, [Name] is generally motivated to be practical and thorough. [He/She] tends to prefer work that is both structured and organized. In the job description, [he/she] may prefer the opportunity to:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;*Analyze 		*Be accurate 		*Be in control 		*Build&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;*Create 		*Critique &amp; improve 	*Decide 		*Develop&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;*Direct 			*Initiate solutions 	*Manage 		*Organize&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;*Plan 			*Quality control 		*Research facts 	*Solve problems&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;*Supervise 		*Think things through 	*Work with data 	*Work with objects&lt;/p&gt;</Detail>
			<Detail Type="ToCommunicateWithAsLeader">&lt;p&gt;Since [Name] is naturally logical, organized and accurate, [he/she] may tend to resist change or become rigid unless [he/she] understands the reasons for the change. Provide the rationale for change, decisions, and actions by offering well-researched details, facts and data, since [he/she] is most likely motivated by logic, not feelings or emotions.&lt;/p&gt;</Detail>
			<Detail Type="ToDisagreeWithAsLeader">&lt;p&gt;Carefully document your position with facts and data that have been well researched before asking [Name] to consider the case. Try not to back [him/her] into a corner; rather, give [him/her] time to consider the evidence. When you make your appeal, strive to be logical rather than emotional. Avoid public embarrassments and corrections with [him/her], who strives for exceptional quality and precision.&lt;/p&gt;</Detail>
			<Detail Type="PossibleNegativePerceptionsOfOthers">&lt;p&gt;[Name] is most likely to be offended by public embarrassment. Others who criticize or correct [him/her] publicly are sure to lose [his/her] respect. [He/She] may see others as disorganized, less prepared, less accurate and unproductive. There may be a tendency by [him/her] to be impatient with less organized people. [He/She] may see those with strong personalities as having a ‘know-it-all’ attitude. Also, [he/she] may be concerned with others not having the details necessary to make a good decision.&lt;/p&gt;</Detail>
			<Detail Type="NegativePerceptionsOthersMayHave">&lt;p&gt;Others may see [Name] as overly concerned with petty details, judgmental or critical. Conflict can ensue over who is in control and correct. Some may perceive [him/her] as rigid and unbending at times. It is quite possible that [he/she] might be perceived as one who ‘bends like a steel post.’ It is conceivable that some will see [him/her] as a perfectionist.&lt;/p&gt;</Detail>
			<Detail Type="NotableCharacteristics">&lt;p&gt;[Name] is likely to be perceived as positive, steady or systematic. [He/She] has a tendency to be direct and straightforward, ‘telling it like it is.’ [He/She] is challenged by difficult problems that require ‘brain power’ and logical analysis and as a result, may be perceived as intellectually curious. Being patient, controlled, moderate and deliberate, [he/she] may prefer working with things, rather than having to influence people. [He/She] may become dissatisfied when searching for the best answer. [He/She] wants to achieve, but may also want to be correct. [His/Her] striving for both accomplishments and quality often leads others to see [him/her] as a perfectionist.&lt;/p&gt;</Detail>
			<Detail Type="FundamentalDesiresDrive">&lt;p&gt;[Name] is most likely to prefer facts, figures and objects rather than working with people. To be successful, [he/she] may need to take additional time to weigh the pros and cons of each situation carefully, doing only one thing at a time.&lt;/p&gt;</Detail>
			<Detail Type="RecommendedImprovements">&lt;p&gt;Bluntness toward some people may be a problem. There may be a tendency toward perfectionism that keeps [Name] from being completely satisfied with anything. This may give the appearance of being indecisive or vacillating. [He/She] would be more effective with more flexibility, tolerance of others who are different from [him/her], and getting more personally involved with others. [He/She] may need to learn to relax more and maintain a healthy balance between private life and work. &lt;/p&gt;</Detail>
			<Detail Type="HowToSuperviseAndEncourage">&lt;p&gt;A manager or supervisor needs to use logic rather than an emotional approach with [Name]. Keep in mind that [he/she] may prefer to work alone on projects and be given challenging problems along with adequate time to arrive at the best answer. [He/She] may also need a manager who is strong enough to remind [him/her] to soften [his/her] approach when dealing with others.&lt;/p&gt;</Detail>

		<Description Name="Supporter" Type="Adaptable" ClassicalDesignation="Phlegmatic">
			<Narrative1>
				<p>Individuals with a SUPPORTER personality profile are typically calm, modest and willing to accommodate others. As a SUPPORTER, [Name] typically leads others and relates in a considerate and personal manner. [He/She] maintains a low profile by blending into work and social situations. [He/She] is usually reliable and works at a steady, consistent and predictable pace, keeping the peace and mediating among contentious people. [He/She] influences others with [his/her] accommodating nature, pleasant posture and consistent work performance.</p>
			</Narrative1>
			<Narrative2>
				<p>[Name] is likely to lead by being helpful to those in the workplace who are considered to be [his/her] friends. [He/She] does not portray people who are ‘movers and shakers,’ but rather, consistent and supportive in their work style. There is an emotional need to keep the peace and [he/she] may become discouraged if the work setting contains conflict. [He/She] quite possibly avoids tense situations, ‘making waves’ or having to make a major change. Advanced warning of surprises or change will allow [him/her] to make important adjustments and</p>
			</Narrative2>
			<Narrative3>
				<p>be more consistent. There can be a considerable amount of emotional energy expended in maintaining a familiar and predictable environment, which may be a challenge to those associates who are innovative. Rapid change generally creates an uncomfortable environment for [Name], who is likely to achieve remarkable consistency in work performance when there is the opportunity to specialize within a predictable environment. Expressed appreciation and affirmations from work associates will go a long way in motivating [him/her].</p>
			</Narrative3>
			<Detail Type="WorkEnvironmentContribution">&lt;p&gt;[Name] is apt to follow through in [his/her] work role in order to bring about steadiness and loyalty in the workplace. [He/She] typically does not ‘rock the boat’ and gets along well with most people. [He/She] maintains a steady pace and is consistent, predictable and a short-term planner.&lt;/p&gt;</Detail>
			<Detail Type="EmotionalPosture">&lt;p&gt;[Name] may be accommodating, non-threatening, gentle, unassertive and moderate when approaching others.&lt;/p&gt;</Detail>
			<Detail Type="DrivingIdeal">&lt;p&gt;[Name] prefers to work in a predictable and controlled environment and maintain the status quo.&lt;/p&gt;</Detail>
			<Detail Type="AssessesOthersBy">&lt;p&gt;Their commitment to friendship, followed by competency.&lt;/p&gt;</Detail>
			<Detail Type="MotivationalStyle">&lt;p&gt;[Name] strives to be pleasing, accommodating and consistent in personal work performance.&lt;/p&gt;</Detail>
			<Detail Type="MostFavorableWorkEnvironment">&lt;p&gt;[Name] desires harmonious relationships, an even pace and considerate work associates.&lt;/p&gt;</Detail>
			<Detail Type="RelationalTaskOrientation">&lt;p&gt;[Name] is prone to be primarily relational but will complete a task in order to be pleasing to work associates or customers.&lt;/p&gt;</Detail>
			<Detail Type="MobilityPreference">&lt;p&gt;Overnight travel is probably not enjoyable for [Name], who prefers consistency, steadiness and regularity in the work environment. Routine is important.&lt;/p&gt;</Detail>
			<Detail Type="EnvironmentalStressors">&lt;p&gt;[Name] is likely to be stressed by conflict, abrupt and unexpected changes, and a lack of consideration, appreciation or predictability.&lt;/p&gt;</Detail>
			<Detail Type="OverUses">&lt;p&gt;Modesty and passivity; [he/she] can be resistant or reluctant to change.&lt;/p&gt;</Detail>
			<Detail Type="WhenPressured">&lt;p&gt;[Name] is apt to be flexible and adapt to the needs of work associates, accommodating the thinking of fellow group members. However, if [his/her] convictions are ‘stomped on,’ there may be a hidden ‘will of iron.’&lt;/p&gt;</Detail>
			<Detail Type="UneasyWhen">&lt;p&gt;There is too much change, disorganization, or conflict.&lt;/p&gt;</Detail>
			<Detail Type="Leadership">&lt;p&gt;[Name] leads by being loyal and dependable.&lt;/p&gt;</Detail>
			<Detail Type="SummaryOfStrengths">&lt;p&gt;Dependable, patient, loyal, cooperative, and a good listener.&lt;/p&gt;</Detail>
			<Detail Type="JobMatch">&lt;p&gt;[Name] is likely to work at an even pace and demonstrate an ability to follow through on projects. [He/She] is apt to be very loyal. In the job description, [he/she] may prefer the opportunity to:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;*Be considerate	  	*Be free of conflict 	*Be relational *Be single-focused   *Be still &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;*Experience familiarity 	*Follow direction  	*Support others&lt;/p&gt;</Detail>
			<Detail Type="ToCommunicateWithAsLeader">&lt;p&gt;Because [Name] is likely to be practical, accurate and organized, there is a tendency for [him/her] to resist change. Work associates may want to approach [him/her] in a gentle and non-controversial manner, giving specifics of how things might need to change. Prepare [him/her] in advance as [he/she] probably does not appreciate surprises or abrupt changes. [He/She] may be motivated by logic on some occasions and by feelings at other times. It might be good to attempt to understand the effects a change might have on [him/her] before pressing to implement those changes.&lt;/p&gt;</Detail>
			<Detail Type="ToDisagreeWithAsLeader">&lt;p&gt;[Name] will want to know if you are ‘in this together.’ Reassuring [him/her] about the relationship is important because [he/she] wants to be seen as a caring, team player. Focus on what is practical and how it has worked in the past. Provide the facts and ask [him/her] to consider them. Don't press hard for an immediate response. Time to process new ideas is of utmost importance. Appeal to both logic and a sense of ‘team-ness.’ Remember that [he/she] likely places a high value on relationships. &lt;/p&gt;</Detail>
			<Detail Type="PossibleNegativePerceptionsOfOthers">&lt;p&gt;[Name] may see those with strong personalities as having a ‘know-it-all’ attitude. [He/She] may build resentment towards someone who is consistently ‘pushy.’ Verbally aggressive people may be annoying and wear [him/her] down. &lt;/p&gt;</Detail>
			<Detail Type="NegativePerceptionsOthersMayHave">&lt;p&gt;Some people who are hard driving may wonder why [Name] isn't more aggressive at times. Others may see [him/her] as overly sensitive and lacking initiative. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;[Name] works at a steady pace but may be perceived by some associates as being ‘pokey.’ Those with more energetic personalities may have to fight the impulse to light a fire under [him/her] to get [him/her] moving at what they consider to be a more suitable pace. [His/Her] steady plodding can be viewed as being unmotivated, which is not necessarily the case.&lt;/p&gt;</Detail>
			<Detail Type="NotableCharacteristics">&lt;p&gt;[Name] is apt to be seen as friendly, dependable and loyal. [He/She] finds a steady pace that works and sticks with it. Having the opportunity to focus on a single task and developing skills in a specialty area is important to [him/her. [His/Her] work pace is probably seen as steady and moderate and performed in a relaxed, mild-mannered style.&lt;/p&gt;</Detail>
			<Detail Type="FundamentalDesiresDrive">&lt;p&gt;[Name] most conceivably desires a job that provides a familiar, consistent and predictable environment. Time to adjust to change is important to [him/her]. There may be a need to focus on one job at a time, doing it thoroughly. [He/She] usually prefers to work at one place rather than traveling overnight or performing a job that is repetitive or specialized. [He/She] strives to maintain close relationships with work associates and is usually very loyal to them.&lt;/p&gt;</Detail>
			<Detail Type="RecommendedImprovements">&lt;p&gt;Concealing grievances and holding grudges can be a problem for [Name] if [he/she] does not speak up to let others know what [he/she] is experiencing. [He/She] may be hesitant at times to initiate change because of a desire to maintain the status quo. One concern a supervisor or manager may need to be aware of is that [he/she] is not very likely to speak up — if at all — until a situation is very strained. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;[Name] may be prone to compromise too much in an attempt to keep the peace. There is also a discomfort with change and risk-taking. [He/She] would benefit by making an effort to stand up for [him/her]self by speaking up more. [He/She] may be hesitant to accept change. Learning to be more flexible would bring more opportunities while benefiting co-workers. [His/Her] effectiveness would increase if [he/she] expressed ideas more, gained self-confidence from the feedback from significant others, and maintained a focus on the important tasks and details. There is a need for [him/her] to learn to cope with a reasonable level of conflict that is bound to occur in the workplace. Accepting change as a natural part of the workplace will increase [his/her] effectiveness. Asserting personal views and preferences are worthwhile goals. &lt;/p&gt;</Detail>
			<Detail Type="HowToSuperviseAndEncourage">&lt;p&gt;[Name] wants to work for a ‘friend’ who truly appreciates [his/her] contribution. A relaxed, amiable manager who shows appreciation and interest will motivate [him/her] toward greater productivity. Using gentle prodding will help [him/her] get started.&lt;/p&gt;</Detail>

		<Description Name="Tough_N_Tender" Type="Powerful/Adaptable" ClassicalDesignation="Choleric/Phlegmatic">
			<Narrative1>
				<p>Individuals with a TOUGH ‘N’ TENDER personality profile exhibit predominately a ‘soft’ demeanor, yet a ‘toughness’ when needed. As a TOUGH ‘N TENDER, [Name] is often motivated by deeply felt convictions, objectives and goals. Adherence to these standards can often take precedence over the group or organization.</p>
				<p>In a work position, it is very conceivable that [Name] may need to consider how to integrate personal goals with the goals of the group. Being accountable to the team, along with exploring ways to accomplish personal goals, would be very beneficial to [his/her] effectiveness with team members. [He/She] likely possesses a strong internal drive for accomplishment, applying the necessary pressure to attain the desired results.</p>
			</Narrative1>
			<Narrative2>
				<p>Delegating important responsibilities may be a struggle unless [he/she] is fairly confident that the job is going to be done right. There may be a tendency to take the job back if another person does not meet [his/her] personal standards.</p>
				<p>Learning to delegate while maintaining an open mind to do things differently would be a positive goal for [him/her], who may easily be tempted to think, ‘If I want to get it right, I better do it myself!’ [He/She] may want to concentrate on keeping lines of communication open among work associates in order to remain free from an ‘either-or’ or ‘black-or-white’ type of thinking. This will also expand options and approaches that are likely to deliver better results.</p>
			</Narrative2>
			<Narrative3>
				<p>[Name] tends to get ‘locked into doing things just one way’ — [his/her] own approach. [He/She] has a strong drive for achievement along with a relational orientation. Finding a good balance between tasks and relationships may be difficult for [him/her]. If careful consideration is not applied, [he/she] may lean sometimes toward achieving the goal at the expense of the relationship. [He/She] is likely perceived as being at ease when it comes to taking a stand on important issues. [He/She] should realize that [his] powerful personality can build or destroy. To affect the former, [he/she] should tread carefully. It would be wise for [him/her] to consider ways to be both adaptable and relational when approaching others. [He/She] is always available when needed.</p>
			</Narrative3>
			<Detail Type="WorkEnvironmentContribution">&lt;p&gt;Persistent and determined in reaching goals, [Name] is strong on follow-through and usually sets and completes important goals and tasks with a determination that rivals that of nearly all others.&lt;/p&gt;</Detail>
			<Detail Type="EmotionalPosture">&lt;p&gt;[Name] seems to possess two opposite postures. At times there will be a posture that is persistent, determined and industrious, displaying frustration when goals are thwarted. Other times, [he/she] may exhibit a soft, relational, and easy-going demeanor. These opposite postures of being both ‘tough and tender’ may be confusing to some coworkers and family members, especially children.&lt;/p&gt;</Detail>
			<Detail Type="DrivingIdeal">&lt;p&gt;Personal accomplishments that are at times at the expense of group goals.&lt;/p&gt;</Detail>
			<Detail Type="AssessesOthersBy">&lt;p&gt;The concrete results they accomplish.&lt;/p&gt;</Detail>
			<Detail Type="MotivationalStyle">&lt;p&gt;Being accountable for [his/her] own work and accomplishments.&lt;/p&gt;</Detail>
			<Detail Type="MostFavorableWorkEnvironment">&lt;p&gt;[Name] prefers to work in a structured environment with clearly defined goals. There is also a need to have the freedom to exercise the authority necessary to accomplish those goals. Predictability and regularity are also desired in the work context.&lt;/p&gt;</Detail>
			<Detail Type="RelationalTaskOrientation">&lt;p&gt;[Name] tends to be very task-oriented but also possesses a propensity to relate well to people. [He/She] may experience tension between tasks and relationships.&lt;/p&gt;</Detail>
			<Detail Type="MobilityPreference">&lt;p&gt;[Name] very conceivably has no difficulty working in one place for an extended period of time while remaining focused on one project, though [he/she] may prefer variety in [his/her] work.&lt;/p&gt;</Detail>
			<Detail Type="EnvironmentalStressors">&lt;p&gt;[Name] may be stressed by people who talk too much, pry into private matters, or display a ‘know-it-all’ attitude. The most significant sources of stress for [him/her] are people who block the achievement of [his/her] goals.&lt;/p&gt;</Detail>
			<Detail Type="OverUses">&lt;p&gt;The ‘busy-ness’ of being absorbed in the task with a tendency to become too self-reliant.&lt;/p&gt;</Detail>
			<Detail Type="WhenPressured">&lt;p&gt;[Name] may become frustrated or impatient and is likely to perform the job alone rather than delegate the work to others.&lt;/p&gt;</Detail>
			<Detail Type="UneasyWhen">&lt;p&gt;Dealing with others who have lower standards that can impact the quality of [his/her] work.&lt;/p&gt;</Detail>
			<Detail Type="Leadership">&lt;p&gt;[Name] is most apt to lead by setting an example and achieving goals and objectives. [His/Her] work ethic may encourage others to work harder. [He/She] quite possibly has an ability to deal directly with people in a calm manner.&lt;/p&gt;</Detail>
			<Detail Type="SummaryOfStrengths">&lt;p&gt;Independent, results-oriented, confident, problem-solver and direct.&lt;/p&gt;</Detail>
			<Detail Type="JobMatch">&lt;p&gt;[Name] possesses a desire to work at a steady pace, follow through on a given assignment and cooperate with others. [He/She] likely prefers work that is structured and organized. Because [he/she] persistently strives to achieve a set goal, effectiveness is maximized when [he/she] is given independence, challenges, problems to solve and obstacles to overcome. [He/She] needs the authority to get the job done and may prefer the opportunity to:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;*Be consistent 			*Be loyal 		*Build 			*Create&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;*Critique &amp; improve 		*Decide 		*Develop 		*Direct&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;*Focus on one task at a time 	*Follow through 	*Initiate solutions 	*Manage&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;*Set a good example 		*Work in one place 	*Specialize 		*Support others &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;  &lt;/p&gt;</Detail>
			<Detail Type="ToCommunicateWithAsLeader">&lt;p&gt;Because [Name] is inclined to be goal- and achievement-oriented, discuss the end result with [him/her] first. Do not get carried away by elaborating on the details before the ‘big picture’ is clear. Provide [him/her] with the reasons for change and a course of action with well-researched facts and data. [He/She] may also play a role as a change agent when change makes sense. [He/She] is inclined to think about the practical details of any goal or objective. There will be a need to know how a given idea will affect the work activity. Use diplomacy and a non-controversial posture when explaining your point of view.&lt;/p&gt;</Detail>
			<Detail Type="ToDisagreeWithAsLeader">&lt;p&gt;Find the ‘big picture’ or common ground upon which you can agree before proposing a new plan or idea. [Name] is highly committed to achieving goals and objectives, while methodology is less important to [him/her]. Be specific on how the new idea has worked in other settings. Offering reassurance that ‘we are in this together’ allows [him/her] to relax when there is change. Taking a ‘team approach’ will be the most effective path toward resolution.&lt;/p&gt;</Detail>
			<Detail Type="PossibleNegativePerceptionsOfOthers">&lt;p&gt;[Name] may see those with strong personalities as ‘steamrollers,’ self-centered, territorial or insensitive. [He/She] may be ‘put off’ by some people who seem to be a ‘lot of talk’ and who do not provide ‘follow-through.’ [He/She] tries not to impose on others and in some situations feels judged by those who do not see things the same way.&lt;/p&gt;</Detail>
			<Detail Type="NegativePerceptionsOthersMayHave">&lt;p&gt;[Name] may appear too sensitive by those with strong personalities, and insensitive or unbending by those with soft personalities. [He/She] may come across to some as being a ‘know-it-all’ and in a skirmish for territory. Some may be confused by finding [him/her] to be very tough-minded in some situations and soft and adaptive at other times. &lt;/p&gt;</Detail>
			<Detail Type="NotableCharacteristics">&lt;p&gt;[Name] is apt to be viewed as determined, logical, tenacious and independent. [He/She] performs most effectively when working hard and is not prone to quick flashes of success. [He/She] analyzes and evaluates problems objectively and is inclined to follow leads and uncover hidden facts concerning a given situation. [He/She] may dominate others at times but will usually do it with patience, taking nothing for granted. [He/She] is likely to be result-oriented and is probably not afraid to voice an opinion.&lt;/p&gt;</Detail>
			<Detail Type="FundamentalDesiresDrive">&lt;p&gt;[Name] is likely to prefer working independently and can be counted on to be thorough and complete on follow-through. [He/She] needs the freedom to question, investigate and follow leads on matters that arouse [his/her] suspicion. [He/She] desires to move at [his/her] own pace and does not want people looking over [his/her] shoulder or keeping tabs on [him/her]. [He/She] aspires to high standards of performance that include quality control and thoroughness.&lt;/p&gt;</Detail>
			<Detail Type="RecommendedImprovements">&lt;p&gt;[Name] may be stubborn at times, thus refusing to change a perspective or position. There is a tendency to be blunt and obstinate in certain situations. [He/She] may initially disbelieve what is presented and by nature will examine the new information from a skeptical posture. Focusing on becoming more open to others’ perspectives without being suspicious, while being sure to establish proof, will go a long way in improving [his/her] relationships. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;[Name] can see the ‘big picture’ but may not fully understand the amount of detailed work required. Seeking feedback from co-workers and friends who are more detail-oriented would help [him/her] gain a better understanding of the details involved in a particular decision. There needs to be a willingness to sacrifice short-term goals to achieve long-term results. Strive to stay free of ‘black/white’ and ‘either/or’ thinking. It is advisable for [him/her] to find a balance between work and private life, and to not be so sensitive to others’ comments or shortcomings. [He/She] may need to receive constructive criticism more gracefully. &lt;/p&gt;</Detail>
			<Detail Type="HowToSuperviseAndEncourage">&lt;p&gt;[Name] quite conceivably views suppression of emotions as virtuous, taking pride in being analytical, logical and thorough. [He/She] is generally candid and will keep [his/her] thinking on track, and is almost impossible to derail. [He/She] can be a challenge for any manager. A direct but sincere approach is the best course to take when managing [him/her]. Do not embarrass [him/her] in public, since [he/she] already has a hard time living up to personal standards. Doing so most certainly will diminish the respect [he/she] holds for you. Being direct and allowing frankness will go a long way. Let [him/her] know what you want, then allow [him/her] space to do the job [his/her] own way. It is very likely that the job will be done correctly.&lt;/p&gt;</Detail>

		<Description Name="Visionary" Type="Powerful" ClassicalDesignation="Choleric">
			<Narrative1>
				<p>Individuals with the VISIONARY personality profile exhibit some of the strongest personality characteristics.
