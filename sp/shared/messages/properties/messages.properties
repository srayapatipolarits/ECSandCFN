Solicit feedback from direct reports, your manager, peers, business partners, and customers to create a statement that resonates broadly.
blueprint.getStarted.cont4 = If the mission clarifies the reason for your being, then Objectives are the two or three strategic areas you will focus on to execute your mission.  As with the mission statement, the Blueprint-building system provides feedback opportunities to help you identify Objectives that are focused and well articulated.

Worthy Key Initiatives require both pushing the boundaries of innovation and making room for flexibility.
