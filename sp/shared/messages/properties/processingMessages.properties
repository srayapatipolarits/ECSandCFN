			 drawing energy from the external world, or those things in which he is involved.

profile.processing.concrete.intutive.summary = At any given time a person is either taking in information or making decisions based upon information already received. \
			 Using concrete or intuitive data are two ways of perceiving information. The <strong>concrete</strong> processor prefers to utilize what \

			 The <strong>intuitive</strong> processor prefers to gather information by application and thinking through as many different scenarios as possible.

			 <strong>heart (affective)</strong> function in making decisions is likely to be more person-centered and/or value-centered. This does not \

			 based on his head.
