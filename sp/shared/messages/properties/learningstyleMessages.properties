#Conditional message, comes, whichever is greater, Global or analytical
profile.learning.global.greater = A <b>global</b> learner sees the big picture or overall view, while the analytical learner focuses on the parts that make \
				 up the big picture. <b>global</b> learners hear new information by listening to the "gist" of what is being communicated, \
				 quickly getting the main idea or topic. Remembering the details may be somewhat difficult. In following directions the \
				 <strong>Global</strong> learner listens for "what is supposed to be done", not necessarily "how to do it". 
profile.learning.analytical.greater = An <b>analytical</b> learner hears new information and tends to listen for specific details. Getting the overall concept \
				 that the details describe may be sometimes difficult for the <b>analytical</b> learner. In following directions, the <b>Analyst</b> \
				 listens for	details and may become particularly frustrated if instructions are repeated.

profile.learning.global.vs.analytical = GLOBAL LEARNER vs. ANALYTICAL LEARNER

profile.learning.global.vs.analytical.p1 = Learning Style explains how the individual interacts with new information. There are two extremes: the <b>global</b> learning style \
			 and the <b>analytical</b> learning style. No person is bound by one learning style.
profile.learning.global.vs.analytical.p2 = However, even though individuals find themselves in both categories, they gravitate toward just one style.
