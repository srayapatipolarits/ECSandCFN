profile.dm.heading = DECISION MAKING
profile.dm.summary =People have four different ways of processing information and making decisions: Outward or Inward Processors, Careful or Rapid Deciders.

# {0} - Firstname
profile.dm.inward.outward.equal = {0} can be both an <strong>Outward</strong> and an <strong>Inward</strong> Processor.

# {0} - He/She
profile.dm.careful.rapid.equal = {0} can be both a <strong>Careful</strong> and a <strong>Rapid</strong> Decider.

profile.dm.inward.careful.unequal  = {0} is an <strong>{1}</strong> Processor and a <strong>{2}</strong> Decider.

#{0} -Firstname, {1}, Inward/Outward
profile.dm.inward.greater.outward = {0} is an <strong>{1}</strong> Processor.

#{0} - He/she, {1} -  Rapid/careful
profile.dm.careful.greater.rapid = {0} is a <strong>{1}</strong> Decider.

profile.dm.note.text = Note: As the indicator box moves toward the center of the graph quadrants, the individual uses more flexibility and adaptability in the decision making. In contrast, when the Decision Making is charted almost fully over a single quadrant it may be problematic.

profile.dm.invaward.vs.outward = OUTWARD PROCESSOR vs. INWARD PROCESSOR

profile.dm.inward.vs.outward.text = A 50/50 result indicates that a person's decision making varies based on the particular situation.

profile.dm.outward.percentage = {0}% OUTWARD PROCESSOR

profile.dm.outward.p1 = <strong>Outward Processors</strong> often utilize interaction with others as a way to process information and arrive at a wise decision. \
			 They have a need to communicate their thoughts openly in order to discern which ideas best contribute to a wise decision. \
			 It is this interaction with others that allows them to convert an idea to a decision.
			
profile.dm.outward.p2 =Others may think this type of person 'thinks out loud', allowing others to hear both their good and bad ideas. Some may get \
			 the impression that <strong>Outward Processors</strong> figure out what they think as they speak. Observers may not fully understand the \
			 need for engaging conversation in order for the <strong>Outward Processor</strong> to organize and clarify the thinking process.
profile.dm.outward.p3 = When this person is in a leadership role, others cannot always tell whether an <strong>Outward Processor</strong> is just 'thinking out loud' \
			 or making a decision. Thoughts are often discovered as words are spoken. Inward Processors may unfairly see the <strong>Outward \
			 Processor</strong> as shallow or careless with their thoughts.

profile.dm.inward.percentage = {0}% INWARD PROCESSOR

profile.dm.inward.p1 = <strong>Inward Processors</strong> usually keep their thoughts private until they are convinced that the ideas are sound. They sort through \
			 their thoughts privately, and discern which ideas best contribute to a wise decision. It is in their private world that \
			 they can solidify their decisions.
profile.dm.inward.p2 = Others may think of this kind of person as one who 'holds their cards close' or even as 'uptight' about sharing thoughts. \
			 Some may get the impression the Inward Processor is unwilling to take the risk of sharing all their ideas. <strong>Inward Processors</strong> \
			 may be accused of not being open to the exchange of ideas, failing to fully understand their need for privacy in order \
			 to organize and clarify the thought process.
profile.dm.inward.p3 = In a leadership position others cannot always get a 'reading' on what the <strong>Inward Processor</strong> is thinking. This type of person \
			 is usually only willing to share ideas that they are convinced are wise. Outward Processors may unfairly see the <strong>Inward Processor</strong> \
			 as uninvolved, non-committal, or withdrawn.  
			
profile.dm.careful.vs.rapid = CAREFUL DECIDER  vs. RAPID DECIDER

profile.dm.careful.vs.rapid.text = A 50/50 result indicates that a person's decision making varies based on the particular situation.

profile.dm.careful.percentage  = {0}% CAREFUL DECIDER

profile.dm.careful.p1 = <strong>Careful Deciders</strong> usually have to investigate all the options before making a decision, wanting to be certain of the outcome. \
			 They tend to go step by step with a methodical style of processing information and arriving at a decision.
profile.dm.careful.p2 = Others may see this kind of person as 'bogging down' the process or as being overly concerned with small matters. 
profile.dm.careful.p3 =
profile.dm.rapid.percentage = {0}% RAPID DECIDER

profile.dm.rapid.p1 = <strong>Rapid Deciders</strong> have a quick sense of what will work and are able to intuitively process information and arrive at a decision without the need to go step by step. 
profile.dm.rapid.p2 = Others may see this kind of person as 'rushing to judgment', carelessly making decisions, which may or may not be the case.
profile.dm.rapid.p3 =
